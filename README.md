# Income & Legislative Effectiveness: Overview
*Final Project from Political Statistics 2 with Professor Arcenaux*
- Used multivariate regressions with interactions to answer the research question "Does the average median income of the districts represented by congressional party caucuses affect that caucus’s ability to pass legislation?"
- Cleaned ACS data and congressional roll call data to create a data set of the average income of a congressional caucus’ congressional districts and the percentage of legislation that comes up for a vote that passes. 
- Added control variables: the size of the majority, political party, whether the same party was in the majority in the other chamber, and whether the president was the same party as the majority in the chamber
- Tested the moderating power of political party on the relationship between income and percent of legislation that is passed by using an interaction in the regression. 
- Ultimately, I found that there is *some* evidence (at 90% confidence) that median family income leads to a higher proportion of legislation passed.

Only keep majority party caucuses because the keeping minority caucuses in the `pct.passrej` variable causes inherent correlation.

## Models
### Multivariate Linear Regression  
The coefficient for inflation adjusted median family income is -0.001 in both of these models which means that for every dollar increase in a congressional majority’s median family income, the percent of passed legislation decreases by 0.001 percent. In other words, a 1000 dollar increase would be associated with a 1 percentage point drop in percentage of legislation that is passed, which is possibly a significant amount given that the standard deviation of median family income is 4228 dollars. However, this measure is not significant at the 95 percent level of confidence.

### Interaction Model  
In this model I also included an interaction model between median family income and party of the majority. I did this to test the second hypothesis: The effect of constituency income on percent of legislation that is passed in Congress will be moderated by the party of the majority caucus in the chamber.  
The coefficient for median family income was 0.005 which means that for every dollar increase in the average median family income of a congressional majority’s districts, the majority will pass 0.005 percent more legislation, or more significantly, for every 1000 dollar increase, the percentage of legislation passed increases by 5 percent.

The coefficient for the interaction term was -0.009 which means that being a Republican majority dampens the effect of median family income on percent of legislation passed by 0.009 percentage points, which is a very small number. This number is also insignificant meaning that we do not have enough data to say that there is a real influence of party on the effect between median family income and proportion of legislation that passes. As we can see from the graph below, although the slope of the regression lines for Republicans and Democrats are different, there is no point at which the confidence intervals do not overlap. Therefore, we cannot be certain that there is a real difference between these lines.

## Conclusion  
In this observational study, I attempted to find evidence linking a congressional majority’s median family income per district to the proportion of how much legislation that comes up for a vote is able to pass. I also have studied whether there is a moderating effect of a congressional majority’s party on this relationship. In future research, it would be helpful to study how income of the people represented by Congress affects how Congress voted on bills from different policy areas. For example, income may have a large effect on the passage of economic policy, but not so much on environmental policy. It may also be interesting to break these larger party caucuses down into smaller subunits such as the Congressional Progressive Caucus in the House or the House Freedom Caucus to see what the relationship is between income and their voting behavior.  
Unfortunately, due to limitations on data collected, I was only able to collect information for 6 Congressional makeups (the 111th to the 116th). Due in part to this small sample size, it was difficult to get a sense of whether coefficients were statistically significant or not. With more data, these models could probably produce clearer results. There is, however, some relatively weak evidence that median family income leads to a higher proportion of legislation passed.
